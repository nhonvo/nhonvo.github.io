### Practice Exercise

Whiteboard a simple e-commerce system. First, design it as a monolith, showing the main components. Then, redesign it as a set of microservices (e.g., Orders, Products, Users). For the microservices design, explain how the 'Place Order' process would work, including how services would communicate (e.g., REST calls vs. a message bus).
