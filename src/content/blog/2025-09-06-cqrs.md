### Practice Exercise

Implement a simple in-memory CQRS pattern. Create a CreateProductCommand and a corresponding CreateProductCommandHandler. Create a GetProductByIdQuery and a corresponding GetProductByIdQueryHandler. The command handler should modify state, and the query handler should only read state. Create a simple 'mediator' to dispatch commands and queries to their handlers.
