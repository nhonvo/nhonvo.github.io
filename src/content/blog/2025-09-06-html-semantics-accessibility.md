### Mind Map Summary

- **Semantic HTML**
  - **What**: Using HTML elements according to their meaning, not their appearance.
  - **Why It Matters**:
    - **Accessibility (a11y)**: Screen readers use semantic tags (`<nav>`, `<h1>`, `<button>`) to understand the page structure and provide navigation shortcuts to users.
    - **SEO**: Search engines use tags like `<article>` and `<h1>` to better understand and rank your content.
    - **Maintainability**: Code is easier for other developers to read and understand.
  - **The Golden Rule**: If a native HTML element exists for the job, use it. (`<button>` is better than `<div role="button">`).
- **Accessibility (a11y)**
  - **What**: The practice of making websites usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.
  - **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)**: The global standard for accessibility, based on four principles (POUR):
    - **P**erceivable: Users must be able to perceive the information (e.g., providing `alt` text for images).
    - **O**perable: Users must be able to operate the interface (e.g., everything works with a keyboard).
    - **U**nderstandable: The content and UI must be clear and predictable.
    - **R**obust: Content must be compatible with a wide range of user agents, including assistive technologies.
  - **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)**
    - **What**: A set of HTML attributes that can enhance accessibility when native semantics are not sufficient.
    - **Use Case**: To add context to non-semantic elements (like a `div` pretending to be a button) or to describe the state of dynamic widgets (e.g., `aria-expanded="true"`).

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Semantic HTML: Writing with Meaning
At its core, semantic HTML is about choosing the right element for the right job. A `<div>` is a generic container; it tells you nothing about its contents. A `<nav>` element, however, explicitly tells browsers, search engines, and screen readers that its contents are the primary navigation links for the page.

- **Non-Semantic Elements**: `<div>`, `<span>`. Use these for purely presentational styling when no other element is appropriate.
- **Structural Elements**: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`. These give your page a clear, machine-readable structure.
- **Text Elements**: `<h1>`-`<h6>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<blockquote>`. These structure your content, which is vital for readability and SEO.
- **Interactive Elements**: `<button>`, `<a>`, `<input>`, `<form>`. Using these native elements is critical because they come with built-in accessibility features, such as being focusable by a keyboard and being understood by screen readers.

#### 2. Accessibility (a11y): Beyond the Visuals
Accessibility means designing for everyone. This includes users who may be blind and use a screen reader, users who cannot operate a mouse and rely on a keyboard, users with low vision who need high contrast, and many others. Using semantic HTML is the foundation of accessibility. A screen reader can announce "Heading level 1" for an `<h1>` or "Button" for a `<button>`, giving essential context to a non-sighted user. If you use a `<div>` for everything, that context is lost.

#### 3. ARIA: Bridging the Gap
The first rule of ARIA is: **don't use ARIA**. If a native HTML element with the right semantics exists, use it. However, for complex, dynamic web applications, you sometimes create components that have no native HTML equivalent (like a custom dropdown menu or a tabbed interface). In these cases, ARIA is essential.

- **`role`**: This attribute tells assistive technologies what a generic element is pretending to be. For example, `<div role="button">` tells a screen reader to treat this `div` as a button.
- **`aria-label`**: Provides an accessible name for an element when there is no visible text (e.g., an icon-only button: `<button aria-label="Close">X</button>`).
- **State Attributes**: Attributes like `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, and `aria-hidden` describe the state of dynamic components.

### Practice Exercise

Audit a simple webpage for accessibility issues. Refactor non-semantic elements (`div`s used for buttons or headers) into their correct semantic counterparts (`button`, `h1`, etc.) and add necessary ARIA attributes.

### Answer

#### "Bad" Code: Non-Semantic and Inaccessible

```html
<div class="header">
  <div class="logo">My Awesome Site</div>
  <div class="nav">
    <span>Home</span>
    <span>About</span>
    <span>Contact</span>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="main-content">
  <div class="page-title">Welcome to my site!</div>
  <p>This is some content.</p>
  <div class="button" onclick="doSomething()">Click Me</div>
</div>
```

**Accessibility Issues:**
1.  **No Structure**: A screen reader just sees a series of `div`s and has no idea what the page structure is.
2.  **Fake Heading**: The `page-title` `div` looks like a heading, but it isn't programmatically a heading.
3.  **Fake Navigation**: The `nav` `div` and `span`s are not identifiable as a navigation block or as links.
4.  **Fake Button**: The `button` `div` is the worst offender. It is not focusable with a keyboard, it doesn't announce itself as a button to screen readers, and it cannot be activated with the Enter or Space keys.

#### "Good" Code: Semantic and Accessible

```html
<header>
  <a href="/" class="logo">My Awesome Site</a>
  <nav aria-label="Main Navigation">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>

<main>
  <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
  <p>This is some content.</p>
  <button type="button" onclick="doSomething()">Click Me</button>
</main>
```

**Improvements:**
1.  **Clear Structure**: The page is now structured with `<header>` and `<main>`, which is immediately understandable to assistive technologies.
2.  **Real Heading**: `<h1>` is used for the main page title. A screen reader user can now use a shortcut to jump directly to the main heading.
3.  **Real Navigation**: `<nav>` defines the navigation region. Using a `<ul>` (unordered list) for the links is a standard, semantic way to structure a list of navigation items. The `aria-label` on the `<nav>` helps distinguish it if there were multiple navigation blocks on the page.
4.  **Real Button**: The `<button>` element is used. This is a huge improvement:
    -   It is automatically focusable via the keyboard (e.g., by pressing Tab).
    -   It can be activated with both the Enter and Space keys.
    -   It announces itself to screen readers as "Button, Click Me".

This refactored version is far more accessible, better for SEO, and easier for other developers to understand and maintain.
