### Mind Map Summary

- **Topic**: Performance & Load Testing
- **Definition**: A type of non-functional testing that evaluates how a system performs in terms of responsiveness, stability, scalability, and resource usage under a particular workload.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - **Performance Testing**: A broad term encompassing various tests to determine a system's speed, responsiveness, and stability under a particular workload.
    - **Load Testing**: Assessing system behavior under anticipated peak load. It helps determine if the infrastructure can handle the expected number of users or transactions.
    - **Stress Testing**: Pushing the system beyond its normal operational limits to identify its breaking point and how it recovers from extreme conditions.
    - **Scalability Testing**: Determining the system's ability to scale up or down to meet increasing or decreasing user demands.
    - **Soak Testing (Endurance Testing)**: Testing the system under a typical load for a prolonged period to detect memory leaks or degradation over time.
    - **Response Time**: The time taken for the system to respond to a user request.
    - **Throughput**: The number of transactions or requests processed by the system per unit of time.
    - **Error Rate**: The percentage of requests that result in an error.
    - **Concurrency**: The number of simultaneous users or requests the system can handle.
- **Benefits (Pros)**:
    - **Identifies Bottlenecks**: Pinpoints areas in the application or infrastructure that are causing performance degradation.
    - **Ensures Scalability**: Verifies that the application can handle increased user loads without compromising performance.
    - **Improves User Experience**: Ensures the application remains responsive and stable, leading to better user satisfaction.
    - **Reduces Risk**: Prevents system failures, crashes, or slowdowns in production under high traffic.
    - **Optimizes Resource Usage**: Helps in right-sizing infrastructure and optimizing code for better resource utilization.
- **Challenges (Cons)**:
    - **Complexity**: Can be complex to design, set up, and execute, requiring specialized skills.
    - **Tooling**: Requires specific tools, which might have a learning curve or licensing costs.
    - **Environment Setup**: Needs a test environment that closely mimics production, which can be challenging to provision and maintain.
    - **Result Interpretation**: Analyzing and interpreting performance metrics to identify root causes can be difficult.
    - **Cost**: Can be resource-intensive in terms of infrastructure and personnel.
- **Common Tools**:
    - **k6**: Modern, open-source load testing tool written in Go, scriptable with JavaScript.
    - **JMeter**: Apache's open-source, Java-based load testing tool, widely used for various protocols.
    - **Azure Load Testing**: A fully managed load testing service on Azure.
    - **Locust**: Open-source, Python-based load testing tool, allowing you to define user behavior in Python code.
    - **Gatling**: Open-source load testing tool based on Scala, Akka, and Netty.
- **Practical Use**:
    - Simulating realistic user traffic patterns.
    - Measuring system performance under various load conditions.
    - Identifying the maximum user capacity before degradation.
    - Validating service level agreements (SLAs).

### Core Concepts

Performance and load testing are crucial for ensuring that applications can handle the expected user traffic and perform reliably under various conditions. Unlike functional tests that verify *what* the system does, performance tests verify *how well* the system performs.

**Load testing** specifically focuses on simulating anticipated user loads to ensure the system remains stable and responsive. **Stress testing** goes a step further, pushing the system beyond its limits to find its breaking point and observe how it behaves under extreme conditions.

Tools like **k6** provide a modern, scriptable approach to defining load test scenarios, allowing developers to integrate performance testing into their CI/CD pipelines.

### Practice Exercise

Using a tool like k6, write a simple load test script. The script should simulate 10 virtual users continuously hitting a specific API endpoint for 30 seconds. Run the test and analyze the results, such as average response time and request rate.

### Answer

For this exercise, we'll use **k6**.

#### 1. Install k6

If you don't have k6 installed, you can download it from the official website ([k6.io](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)) or use a package manager:

**Windows (with Winget):**
```bash
winget install k6
```

**macOS (with Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install k6
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 379CE192D401AB61
echo "deb https://dl.k6.io/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/k6.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install k6
```

#### 2. Create a k6 Test Script (`test.js`)

Let's assume you have an API endpoint at `http://localhost:5000/api/products`.

```javascript
// test.js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { sleep } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  // Simulate 10 virtual users (VUs)
  vus: 10,
  // Run the test for 30 seconds
  duration: '30s',
  // Define thresholds for pass/fail criteria (optional but recommended)
  thresholds: {
    // 95% of requests must complete within 200ms
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<200'],
    // The error rate must be below 1%
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'],
  },
};

export default function () {
  // Make a GET request to the API endpoint
  http.get('http://localhost:5000/api/products');

  // Pause for a short duration to simulate user think time
  sleep(1);
}
```

#### 3. Run the Test

Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved `test.js`, and run the test:

```bash
k6 run test.js
```

#### 4. Analyze the Results

After the test completes, k6 will output a summary to the console. Here's an example of what you might see and how to interpret it:

```
          /\      |‾‾| /‾‾/   /\
     /\  /  \     |  |/  /   /  \
    /  \/    \    |   /  /  /    \
   /          \   |  /  /  /      \
  / __________ \  | /  /  /________\
 /_____________\]  |/  /_____________ 

     running (30.0s), 10 VUs, 300 complete and 0 interrupted iterations
     ✓ http_req_duration..............: avg=15.23ms  min=10.12ms med=14.56ms max=35.89ms p(90)=18.01ms p(95)=19.50ms
       http_req_failed..............: 0.00%   ✓ 0        ✗ 300
       http_req_waiting.............: avg=15.23ms  min=10.12ms med=14.56ms max=35.89ms p(90)=18.01ms p(95)=19.50ms
       http_reqs....................: 300    9.999999/s
       iteration_duration...........: avg=1015.23ms min=1010.12ms med=1014.56ms max=1035.89ms p(90)=1018.01ms p(95)=1019.50ms
       iterations...................: 300    9.999999/s
       vus..........................: 10     min=10     max=10
       vus_max......................: 10     min=10     max=10
```

**Key Metrics to Analyze:**

*   **`http_req_duration`**: This is the most important metric. It shows the total time for the HTTP request, including DNS lookup, TCP connection, TLS handshake, and response receive time.
    *   `avg`: Average response time (e.g., 15.23ms).
    *   `min`, `med`, `max`: Minimum, median, and maximum response times.
    *   `p(90)`, `p(95)`: 90th and 95th percentile response times. This means 90% (or 95%) of requests completed within this time. These are crucial for understanding user experience.
*   **`http_req_failed`**: The percentage of failed HTTP requests. In this example, `0.00%` indicates no failures. Our threshold `rate<0.01` (less than 1% error rate) would pass.
*   **`http_reqs`**: Total number of HTTP requests made during the test (e.g., 300).
*   **`http_reqs / s`**: Requests per second, or throughput (e.g., 9.999999/s). This indicates how many requests the system can handle per second.
*   **`iterations`**: Total number of times the `default` function (your test scenario) was executed.
*   **`vus`**: Virtual Users. Shows the number of active virtual users during the test.

**Analysis for this example:**

*   The average response time is very low (15.23ms), which is excellent.
*   95% of requests completed within 19.50ms, which is well within our 200ms threshold.
*   There were no failed requests (`0.00%` error rate).
*   The system handled approximately 10 requests per second.

This indicates that the API endpoint performed very well under the simulated load of 10 concurrent users for 30 seconds. If the `http_req_duration` percentiles were higher than expected, or the `http_req_failed` rate was significant, it would indicate a performance bottleneck or stability issue that needs investigation.
