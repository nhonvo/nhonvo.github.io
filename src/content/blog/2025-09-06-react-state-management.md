### Mind Map Summary

- **The Problem: Prop Drilling**
  - **What**: Passing props down through multiple layers of nested components, even through components that don't need the data themselves.
  - **Why It's Bad**: Makes code verbose, hard to maintain, and tightly coupled.
- **The Solutions: Global State Management**
  - **Context API (Built-in to React)**
    - **Core Idea**: Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without prop drilling.
    - **How it Works**: A `Provider` component makes a value available, and any child component can subscribe to it using the `useContext` Hook.
    - **Best For**: **Low-frequency updates** and simple global state, like theme information, user authentication status, or language preference.
    - **Pros**: Simple, built-in, easy to set up.
    - **Cons**: Can cause performance issues with high-frequency updates, as every component consuming the context will re-render when the value changes.
  - **Redux (Third-party Library)**
    - **Core Idea**: A predictable state container that centralizes your application's state in a single "store".
    - **How it Works (The Redux Pattern)**:
      1.  **UI** dispatches an **Action** (an object describing what happened).
      2.  A **Reducer** (a pure function) receives the action and the current state, and returns the **new state**.
      3.  The **Store** updates, and the UI re-renders based on the new state.
    - **Best For**: **Complex, high-frequency state** that is central to your application's logic (e.g., a complex form, a shopping cart, real-time data feeds).
    - **Pros**: Highly optimized for performance, predictable state changes, powerful developer tools (time-travel debugging).
    - **Cons**: More boilerplate and a steeper learning curve than Context.

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Context API
The Context API is React's built-in solution to prop drilling. It's designed to share data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user or the UI theme. You create a `Context` object, wrap a part of your component tree in its `Provider`, and any component within that tree can read the context's value using the `useContext` hook. While it's very convenient, it's not optimized for performance in the same way Redux is. When the context value changes, every component that uses that context will re-render, which can be slow if the updates are frequent or the component tree is large.

#### 2. Redux
Redux is a more robust and powerful state management library. It enforces a stricter, one-way data flow that makes your application's state changes predictable and easier to debug. The core principles are:
- **Single Source of Truth**: The entire state of your application is stored in a single object tree within a single `store`.
- **State is Read-Only**: The only way to change the state is to dispatch an `action`, an object describing what happened.
- **Changes are made with Pure Functions**: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure `reducers`.

Modern Redux, with **Redux Toolkit**, has significantly reduced the boilerplate and complexity, making it much easier to use. Its primary advantage over Context is performance and tooling. Redux is highly optimized so that components only re-render when the specific piece of data they need from the store actually changes. The Redux DevTools also allow for powerful features like time-travel debugging, where you can step backward and forward through state changes.

### Practice Exercise

Build a small application with a global theme (light/dark mode). Implement the theme toggle twice: once using the Context API and once using Redux. Discuss the pros and cons of each approach for this use case.

### Answer

This use case (a global theme) is a perfect example of where the **Context API shines** and Redux would likely be overkill.

#### 1. Implementation with Context API

```jsx
// theme-context.js
import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = createContext();

export function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');
  const toggleTheme = () => setTheme(prevTheme => (prevTheme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'));

  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, toggleTheme }}>
      {children}
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

export const useTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext);

// App.js
import { ThemeProvider, useTheme } from './theme-context';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <Layout />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

function Layout() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
  const style = { background: theme === 'light' ? '#fff' : '#333', color: theme === 'light' ? '#000' : '#fff' };

  return (
    <div style={style}>
      <h1>Current Theme: {theme}</h1>
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle Theme</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 2. Implementation with Redux (using Redux Toolkit)

```jsx
// themeSlice.js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const themeSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'theme',
  initialState: { value: 'light' },
  reducers: {
    toggleTheme: state => {
      state.value = state.value === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
    },
  },
});

export const { toggleTheme } = themeSlice.actions;
export default themeSlice.reducer;

// store.js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import themeReducer from './themeSlice';

export const store = configureStore({ reducer: { theme: themeReducer } });

// App.js (requires <Provider store={store}> at the root)
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { toggleTheme } from './themeSlice';

function Layout() {
  const theme = useSelector(state => state.theme.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const style = { background: theme === 'light' ? '#fff' : '#333', color: theme === 'light' ? '#000' : '#fff' };

  return (
    <div style={style}>
      <h1>Current Theme: {theme}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(toggleTheme())}>Toggle Theme</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Discussion and Conclusion

-   **Context API Pros (for this use case)**: 
    -   **Simplicity**: The code is much simpler and requires significantly less setup. We created a context and a provider in a few lines of code.
    -   **Built-in**: No third-party libraries are needed.
    -   **Performance**: Since the theme changes very infrequently, the performance drawback of Context (re-rendering all consumers) is completely irrelevant here.

-   **Redux Cons (for this use case)**:
    -   **Boilerplate**: Even with Redux Toolkit, the setup is more complex. We had to create a slice, a store, and wrap the app in a `Provider`. 
    -   **Overkill**: Using Redux for a single, simple boolean-like state is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The powerful features of Redux (middleware, time-travel debugging) provide no real benefit for this simple scenario.

**Conclusion**: For managing a global theme, the **Context API is the clear winner**. It provides a simple, clean, and perfectly adequate solution. Redux should be reserved for when the application's core state becomes more complex and updates more frequently.
