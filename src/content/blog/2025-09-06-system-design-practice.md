Design a high-level architecture for a real-time notification system. Discuss: 1) How clients (web/mobile) would connect, 2) How the backend would push notifications, 3) How to handle millions of concurrent connections, 4) The data model for storing notifications. (Hint: Consider SignalR, WebSockets, Message Queues).
