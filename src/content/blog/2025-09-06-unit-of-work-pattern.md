### Practice Exercise

Create a UnitOfWork class that encapsulates a DbContext and provides access to multiple repositories (e.g., IProductRepository, IOrderRepository). Implement a CompleteAsync method that calls SaveChangesAsync on the context. Use this unit of work in a service layer to perform a multi-step business operation.
