### Mind Map Summary

- **Topic**: Chaos Engineering
- **Definition**: The discipline of experimenting on a distributed system in order to build confidence in the system's capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.
- **Principles**:
    - **Hypothesize about Steady State**: Start by defining a measurable output of your system that indicates normal behavior.
    - **Vary Real-World Events**: Introduce failures into the system, such as server crashes, network latency, and disk failures.
    - **Run Experiments in Production**: Run experiments in a production environment to get a realistic understanding of how the system behaves under stress.
    - **Automate Experiments to Run Continuously**: Automate experiments to run continuously to ensure that the system remains resilient over time.
- **Benefits**:
    - **Increased Resilience**: Proactively identify and fix weaknesses in the system before they cause outages.
    - **Improved Understanding of the System**: Gain a better understanding of how the system behaves under stress.
    - **Increased Confidence in the System**: Build confidence in the system's ability to withstand failures.

### Practice Exercise

Design a chaos experiment for a microservices-based application. For example, what would you test by injecting latency between the API gateway and a downstream service? What tool could you use (e.g., Chaos Monkey, Azure Chaos Studio)?

### Answer

**Chaos Experiment: Injecting Latency**

-   **Hypothesis**: If we inject 500ms of latency between the API gateway and the product service, the user-facing dashboard will still load within 2 seconds.
-   **Experiment**:
    1.  **Select a tool**: We will use Azure Chaos Studio to inject the latency.
    2.  **Define the blast radius**: We will run the experiment in a single region in our pre-production environment.
    3.  **Inject the failure**: We will use Azure Chaos Studio to inject 500ms of latency between the API gateway and the product service for 10 minutes.
    4.  **Measure the impact**: We will monitor the load time of the user-facing dashboard during the experiment.
-   **Verification**: We will verify that the dashboard load time remains within the 2-second SLA.
-   **Learnings**: If the dashboard load time exceeds the SLA, we will investigate the cause and implement a fix, such as adding a timeout or a circuit breaker.
